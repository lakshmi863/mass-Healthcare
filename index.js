            Breathing is the crux of our lives; the effects of inhalation and exhalation of air extend far beyond the basic exchange of air in and out of the body. They extend to the functioning of the heart and lungs as well as to subtle molecular processes through which the body’s energy production is maintained. We breathe with the help of the respiratory system which includes the lungs, the airways, and the respiratory muscles. A problem with any of these will result in difficult respiratory conditions which require immediate treatment. Respiratory medicine also has improved significantly and treating respiratory disorders are much more effective now than in the past.

Pulmonologists are specialized doctors for treatment of respiratory diseases. Pulmonology is classified as an internal medicine sub-specialty as it involves a variety of clinical problems and it requires specialists to provide treatment.
