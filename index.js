Gastroenterology doctors can help patients suffering from a health problem related to esophagus, stomach, gallbladder, bile ducts, colon, liver, pancreas and rectum. The functioning of the entire digestive system, both related to the passage of food through the digestive canal to the physiological processes of food digestion, absorption and elimination come under the purview of this speciality.

Often, your general physician may recommend a nearby gastro hospital if he suspects you may need treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which causes symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever, joint pain, rectal bleeding, ulcers, weight loss and loss of appetite and other digestive issues.

The symptoms of coeliac disease, an autoimmune disease in which the body does not have the ability to process gluten (found in wheat, rye and barley), could also lead you to seek the help of gastroenterology doctors.

            Breathing is the crux of our lives; the effects of inhalation and exhalation of air extend far beyond the basic exchange of air in and out of the body. They extend to the functioning of the heart and lungs as well as to subtle molecular processes through which the bodyâ€™s energy production is maintained. We breathe with the help of the respiratory system which includes the lungs, the airways, and the respiratory muscles. A problem with any of these will result in difficult respiratory conditions which require immediate treatment. Respiratory medicine also has improved significantly and treating respiratory disorders are much more effective now than in the past.

Pulmonologists are specialized doctors for treatment of respiratory diseases. Pulmonology is classified as an internal medicine sub-specialty as it involves a variety of clinical problems and it requires specialists to provide treatment.
